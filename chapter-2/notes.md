# Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works – A Detailed Exploration  

Bitcoin operates in a fundamentally different way from traditional payment systems. Instead of relying on trusted third parties like banks, Bitcoin enables anyone with its software to independently verify and interact with the system. This chapter explains how Bitcoin works by following a transaction through the network and exploring its technical underpinnings.

## Overview of Bitcoin  

At a high level, the Bitcoin system involves the following components:  
- **Users** with wallets containing cryptographic keys.  
- **Transactions** that are propagated across the network.  
- **Miners** who validate transactions and secure the network by building the blockchain.  

The blockchain serves as Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, recording every transaction. Blockchain explorers, such as Blockstream Explorer or Mempool.Space, allow users to inspect transactions, blocks, and their relationships.

## Transactions: The Building Blocks  

A Bitcoin transaction communicates a transfer of ownership. It consists of:  
- **Inputs**: Debits from the sender’s wallet (previously received bitcoins (outputs)).  
- **Outputs**: Credits to the recipient’s wallet.  

Think of transactions like bookkeeping entries, where the inputs and outputs must balance, except for a small transaction fee paid to miners. For instance:
- Alice sends 0.001 BTC to Bob, deducting it from her wallet.  
- The transaction becomes a record in the blockchain, available for verification.

## Transaction Flow  

### 1. **Creating the Transaction**  
Alice’s wallet constructs the transaction using one or more of her unspent outputs (UTXOs). It includes:  
- The recipient’s Bitcoin address (Bob’s address (think of address as a bank account for now)).  
- The amount to be transferred.  
- A digital signature proving ownership of the funds (i.e the person creating the transaction or spending the transaction has the right to do so).  

### 2. **Broadcasting to the Network**  
The transaction is sent to the Bitcoin network, where nodes verify its validity. Each node ensures that:  
- The inputs exist and are unspent.  
- The digital signature matches the sender’s private key.  

### 3. **Recording in the Blockchain**  
Miners package valid transactions into a block and attempt to solve a cryptographic puzzle (Proof-of-Work). Once a miner succeeds, the block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is confirmed.

## Understanding Transaction Chains  

Bitcoin transactions form a chain of ownership:  
1. Alice receives bitcoin from Joe in one transaction (Tx1).  
2. Alice uses the bitcoin in Tx1 as the input for her payment to Bob (Tx2).  
3. Bob can now spend the bitcoin received in Tx2 in a new transaction.  

Each transaction references its input by pointing to the output of a previous transaction, ensuring traceability and integrity.

## Mining: Securing the Network  

Miners play a crucial role in Bitcoin by:  
1. Validating and grouping transactions into blocks.  
2. Solving a cryptographic puzzle to add their block to the chain.  

This process requires computational power, ensuring security and preventing fraud. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.

## Practical Insights  

### Paying with Bitcoin  
When Alice purchases a podcast from Bob’s online store, the process involves:  
- Generating an invoice with a QR code containing Bob’s Bitcoin address and payment details.  
- Alice scanning the QR code with her wallet, pre-filling the payment information.  
- Sending the payment, which is broadcast to the network and recorded on the blockchain.

### Handling Change  
Bitcoin transactions work similarly to cash payments. If Alice sends more than the required amount, her wallet creates a second output to return the “change” to herself.

## Security and Trust  

Bitcoin’s decentralized structure ensures that:  
- Users can independently verify all transactions.  
- The system is resilient to fraud, double-spending, and counterfeiting.  

Each user operates in a trustless environment, relying solely on the cryptographic integrity of the system.

## Conclusion  

This chapter demystifies the workings of Bitcoin by illustrating how transactions are created, validated, and recorded. It highlights the interconnectedness of users, transactions, and miners in maintaining the network. Subsequent chapters will delve deeper into the technologies behind wallets, keys, and mining processes.
